    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Every baker needs a solid vanilla cake recipe in their repertoire, and today’s recipe is just that.</p>
    <p>It’s soft, plush, and perfectly moist. Not to be confused with my white cake, this recipe is a beautiful pale golden color and distinctly vanilla flavored. It pairs beautifully with any frosting, although a traditional chocolate frosting is my favorite finish!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Oil and butter</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cream the butter, oil, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, add your vanilla and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Combine your dry ingredients in a separate bowl, then add about ⅓ of the mixture into your bowl. Use a spatula to gently stir until just combined. Follow this with about ½ of your buttermilk, and stir again until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add ½ of the remaining dry ingredients stir, and then add the remainder of the buttermilk. Finish with the final portion of dry ingredients and use your spatula to make sure the batter is smooth–do NOT overmix!</li>
    </ol>
