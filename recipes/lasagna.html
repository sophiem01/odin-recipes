    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Lasagna Recipe is easy to make with a creamy ricotta cheese mixture, savory meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. </p>
    <p>BONUS: it’s make-ahead and freezer-friendly!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cheese Filling</h3>
    <uo>
        <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups mozarella</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning, to taste</li>
    </uo>

    <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
    <uo>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>3/4 lb ground beef</li>
    </uo>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
