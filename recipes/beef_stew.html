    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic French beef stew is the ultimate cold weather comfort food. After a few hours in the oven, the meat becomes meltingly tender and enveloped in a rich wine sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs boneless beef chuck</li>
        <li>2 tsps salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F and set a rack in the lower middle position.</li>
        <li>at the beef dry and season with the salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven or heavy soup pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Brown the meat in 3 batches, turning with tongs, for about 5 minutes per batch; add one tablespoon more oil for each batch. (To sear the meat properly, do not crowd the pan and let the meat develop a nice brown crust before turning with tongs.) Transfer the meat to a large plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the onions, garlic and balsamic vinegar; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon and scraping the brown bits from bottom of the pan, for about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook for a minute more. Add the beef with its juices back to the pan and sprinkle with the flour.</li>

    </ol>
